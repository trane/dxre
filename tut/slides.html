# Regular Language: wikipedia definition

The collection of regular languages over an alphabet Σ is defined recursively as follows:

- The empty language Ø, and the empty string language {ε} are regular languages.
- For each a ∈ Σ (a belongs to Σ), the singleton language {a} is a regular language.
- If A and B are regular languages, then A ∪ B (union), A • B (concatenation), and A* (Kleene star) are regular languages.
- No other languages over Σ are regular.

---

# Regular Language: practitioners definition

any language that is accepted by a regular expression

---

# Context-free Language

a regular language + recursion

???

this means that any cfg can be expressed with regular expression and a stack

---

# Regular Language Operations

- union K ∪ L
- intersection K ∩ L
- complement ~L
- difference K-L
- concatenation K ∘ L
- Kleene star L*

---

# What do most regex libraries give us?

- union K ∪ L
- ~~intersection K ∩ L~~
- ~~complement ~L~~
- ~~difference K-L~~
- concatenation K ∘ L
- Kleene star L*

---

# Motivation

- Derivatives handle all regular language operations
- Derivatives handle all context-free languages (including left-recursive)

---

# Brzozowski's derivative algorithm

The derivative of a language L with respect to a character c, written Dc(L):

1. Filter: Find all of the strings in L that start with c.
1. Chop: the c off all those strings.

If the final language contains the "null-string", then the character is in original language.

---

# Brzozowski's derivative algorithm

Example: 

```
Dm(monad|monoid|arrow)* = (onad|onoid)(monad|monoid|arrow)*
```

---

# Brzozowski's derivative algorithm on Strings

Compute the derivative of the first character, then the second, then the third, etc

If the result language contains the "null-string", then the original string is in the language

Done.

---

# Math

- empty language Ø, and the empty string language {ε} are regular languages.
- union K ∪ L
- intersection K ∩ L
- complement ~L
- difference K-L
- concatenation K ∘ L
- Kleene star L*

---

# Math

Derivative of a language with respect to character `c`
- Dc(∅) = ∅
- Dc(ε) = ∅
- Dc(c) = ε
- Dc(c') = ∅ if c is not c'
- Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B if A does not contain the empty string
- Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B ∪ Dc(B) if A contains the empty string
- Dc(A ∪ B) = Dc(A) ∪ Dc(B)
- Dc(A ∩ B) = Dc(A) ∩ Dc(B)
- Dc(A - B) = Dc(A) - Dc(B)
- Dc(A*) = Dc(A)○A*

---

# Math

Nullability test 
- δ(∅) = false
- δ(ε) = true
- δ(c) = false
- ~δ(c) = ~δ(c) 
- δ(A ○ B) = δ(A) and δ(B)
- δ(A ∪ B) = δ(A) or δ(B)
- δ(A ∩ B) = δ(A) and δ(B)
- δ(A - B) = δ(A) and ~δ(B)
- δ(A*) = ε

---

# Code: Regular Expression

We have a `nullable` check, derive function, as well as this string matcher
```tut:silent
sealed trait Regex {
  def nullable: Boolean
  def derive(c: Char): Regex
  def matches(str: String): Boolean
}
```
---

# Code: Regular Expression

We can just implement the string matcher

```tut:silent
sealed trait Regex {
  def nullable: Boolean
  def derive(c: Char): Regex
  def matches(str: String): Boolean = str.length match {
    case 0 => nullable
    case n => derive(str.head).matches(str.tail)
  }
}
```

case object Empty extends Regex {
  val nullable = ???
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = Empty
}
```

---

```tut:silent
case object Empty extends Regex {
  val nullable = false
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = Empty
}
```

---

# Code: Null and Empty Languages

`Dc(ε) = ∅`: the derivative of the Null-string language is the Empty lanaguage

case class Complement(base: Regex) extends Regex {
  lazy val nullable = !base.nullable
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = Complement(base.derive(c))
}
```

# Code: Sequence/Concat

`Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B if ε not in A`

`Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B ∪ Dc(B) if ε not in A`

`δ(A ○ B) = δ(A) and δ(B)`
