# Regular Language: wikipedia definition

The collection of regular languages over an alphabet Σ is defined recursively as follows:

- The empty language Ø, and the empty string language {ε} are regular languages.
- For each a ∈ Σ (a belongs to Σ), the singleton language {a} is a regular language.
- If A and B are regular languages, then A ∪ B (union), A • B (concatenation), and A* (Kleene star) are regular languages.
- No other languages over Σ are regular.

---

# Regular Language: practitioners definition

any language that is accepted by a regular expression

---

# Context-free Language

a regular language + recursion

???

this means that any cfg can be expressed with regular expression and a stack

---

# Regular Language Operations

- union K ∪ L
- intersection K ∩ L
- complement ~L
- difference K-L
- concatenation K ∘ L
- Kleene star L*

---

# What do most regex libraries give us?

- union K ∪ L
- ~~intersection K ∩ L~~
- ~~complement ~L~~
- ~~difference K-L~~
- concatenation K ∘ L
- Kleene star L*

---

# Motivation

- Derivatives handle *all* regular language operations
- Derivatives handle *all* context-free languages (including left-recursive)

---

# Brzozowski's derivative algorithm

The derivative of a language L with respect to a character c, written Dc(L):

1. Filter: Find all of the strings in L that start with c.
1. Chop: the c off all those strings.

If the final language contains the "null-string", then the character is in original language.

---

# Brzozowski's derivative algorithm

Example: 

```
Dm(monad|monoid|arrow)* = (onad|onoid)(monad|monoid|arrow)*
```

---

# Brzozowski's derivative algorithm on Strings

Compute the derivative of the first character, then the second, then the third, etc

If the result language contains the "null-string", then the original string is in the language

Done.

---

# Math

- empty language Ø, and the empty string language {ε} are regular languages.
- union K ∪ L
- intersection K ∩ L
- complement ~L
- difference K-L
- concatenation K ∘ L
- Kleene star L*

???

So, we are going to implement all of these in the next couple of minutes. We need two things:
what is the derivative and the nullability test

---

# Tools we need

1. Derivative of operation
2. Nullability test of operation

---

# Derivative Math

Derivative of a language with respect to character `c`
- Dc(∅) = ∅
- Dc(ε) = ∅
- Dc(c) = ε
- Dc(c') = ∅ if c is not c'
- Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B if A does not contain the empty string
- Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B ∪ Dc(B) if A contains the empty string
- Dc(A ∪ B) = Dc(A) ∪ Dc(B)
- Dc(A ∩ B) = Dc(A) ∩ Dc(B)
- Dc(A - B) = Dc(A) - Dc(B)
- Dc(A*) = Dc(A)○A*

---

# Nullability Math

Nullability test 
- δ(∅) = false
- δ(ε) = true
- δ(c) = false
- ~δ(c) = ~δ(c) 
- δ(A ○ B) = δ(A) and δ(B)
- δ(A ∪ B) = δ(A) or δ(B)
- δ(A ∩ B) = δ(A) and δ(B)
- δ(A - B) = δ(A) and ~δ(B)
- δ(A*) = ε

---

# Code: Regular Expression

We have a `nullable` check, derive function
```scala
sealed trait Regex {
  def nullable: Boolean
  def derive(c: Char): Regex
}
```

???

We code these tools into this trait

---

# Code: Regular Expression

And for testing, let's add a "matches"

```scala
sealed trait Regex {
  def nullable: Boolean
  def derive(c: Char): Regex
  def matches(str: String): Boolean
}
```

---

# Code: Regular Expression

Which we can implement for `String` using our two tools.

```scala
sealed trait Regex {
  def nullable: Boolean
  def derive(c: Char): Regex
  def matches(str: String): Boolean = str.length match {
    case 0 => nullable
    case n => derive(str.head).matches(str.tail)
  }
}
```

---

# Our Regex ADT

Implement `nullable` and `derive` for each of these...

```scala
sealed trait Regex
// ∅
case object Empty extends Regex
// ε
case object Blank extends Regex
// c
case class Single(c: Char) extends Regex
// Complement: ~L
case class Complement(base: Regex) extends Regex
// Concat: A ○ B
case class Sequence(left: Regex, right: Regex) extends Regex
// Union: A ∪ B
case class Choice(left: Regex, right: Regex) extends Regex
// Kleene*: A*
case class Repetition(base: Regex) extends Regex
// Difference: A - B
case class Difference(x: Regex, y: Regex) extends Regex
```

---

# Code: Null and Empty Languages

```scala
case object Empty extends Regex {
  val nullable = ???
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = ???
}
```

???

How do we implement the regex for Empty?

---

# Code: Null and Empty Languages

```scala
case object Empty extends Regex {
  val nullable = ???
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = Empty
}
```
`Dc(∅) = ∅`: The derivative of a character wrt Empty language is the Empty language

---

# Code: Null and Empty Languages

```scala
case object Empty extends Regex {
  val nullable = false
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = Empty
}
```
`Dc(∅) = ∅`: The derivative of a character wrt Empty language is the Empty language

`δ(∅) = false` The Empty language is not nullable

---

# Code: Null and Empty Languages

```scala
case object Blank extends Regex {
  val nullable = ???
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = ???
}
```
`Dc(ε) = ∅`: the derivative of the Null-string language is the Empty language

`δ(ε) = true`: The Null language is nullable

---

# Code: Null and Empty Languages

```scala
case object Blank extends Regex {
  val nullable = true
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = Empty
}
```
`Dc(ε) = ∅`: the derivative of the Null-string language is the Empty language

`δ(ε) = true`: The Null language is nullable
---

# Code: Single character language


```scala
case class Single(c: Char) extends Regex {
  val nullable = ???
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = ???
}
```
`Dc(c) = ε`: the derivative of the character language is the Null-string language

`δ(c) = false`: single character language is not nullable

---

# Code: Single character language


```scala
case class Single(c: Char) extends Regex {
  val nullable = false
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = if (c == this.c) Blank else Empty
}
```
`Dc(c) = ε`: the derivative of the character language is the Null-string language

`δ(c) = false`: single character language is not nullable
---

# Code: Complement


```scala
case class Complement(base: Regex) extends Regex {
  lazy val nullable = ???
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = ???
}
```
`Dc(c') = ∅ if c is not c'`: the derivative of the complement is Empty language if `c` is not `c'`

`δ(c') = ~δ(c')`: complement is nullable if c is not nullable
---

# Code: Complement


```scala
case class Complement(base: Regex) extends Regex {
  lazy val nullable = !base.nullable
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = Complement(base.derive(c))
}
```
`Dc(c') = ∅ if c is not c'`: the derivative of the complement is Empty language if `c` is not `c'`

`δ(c') = ~δ(c')`: complement is nullable if c is not nullable

---

# Code: Sequence/Concat


```scala
case class Sequence(left: Regex, right: Regex) extends Regex {
  lazy val nullable = ???
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = ???
}
```
`Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B if ε not in A`

`Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B ∪ Dc(B) if ε not in A`

`δ(A ○ B) = δ(A) and δ(B)`

---

# Code: Sequence/Concat


```scala
case class Sequence(left: Regex, right: Regex) extends Regex {
  lazy val nullable = left.nullable && right.nullable
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = ???
}
```
`Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B if ε not in A`

`Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B ∪ Dc(B) if ε not in A`

`δ(A ○ B) = δ(A) and δ(B)`

???
We'll need the union type first

---

# Code: Union/Choice/Or


```scala
case class Choice(left: Regex, right: Regex) extends Regex {
  lazy val nullable = ???
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = ???
}
```
`Dc(A ∪ B) = Dc(A) ∪ Dc(B)`: the derivative of the union is the union of the derivatives

`δ(A ∪ B) = δ(A) or δ(B)`: nullability of (A or B) is the nullability of A or the nullability of B

---

# Code: Union/Choice/Or


```scala
case class Choice(left: Regex, right: Regex) extends Regex {
  lazy val nullable = left.nullable || right.nullable
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = Choice(left.derive(c), right.derive(c))
}
```
`Dc(A ∪ B) = Dc(A) ∪ Dc(B)`: the derivative of the union is the union of the derivatives

`δ(A ∪ B) = δ(A) or δ(B)`: nullability of (A or B) is the nullability of A or the nullability of B
---

# Code: Sequence/Concat


```scala
case class Sequence(left: Regex, right: Regex) extends Regex {
  lazy val nullable = left.nullable && right.nullable
  def derive(c: Char): Regex =
    if (left.nullable) Choice(Sequence(left.derive(c), right), right.derive(c))
    else Sequence(left.derive(c), right)
}
```
`Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B if ε not in A`

`Dc(A ○ B) = Dc(A) ○ B ∪ Dc(B) if ε not in A`

`δ(A ○ B) = δ(A) and δ(B)`
---

# Code: Repetition/Kleene*


```scala
case class Repetition(base: Regex) extends Regex {
  val nullable = ???
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = ???
}
```
`Dc(A*) = Dc(A)○A*`: the derivative of `A*` is the derivative of `A` concatenated with `A*`

`δ(A*) = ε`: repetition is nullable
---

# Code: Repetition/Kleene*


```scala
case class Repetition(base: Regex) extends Regex {
  val nullable = true
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = Sequence(base.derive(c), base)
}
```
`Dc(A*) = Dc(A)○A*`: the derivative of `A*` is the derivative of `A` concatenated with `A*`

`δ(A*) = ε`: repetition is nullable
---

# Code: Difference

```scala
case class Difference(x: Regex, y: Regex) extends Regex {
  lazy val nullable = ???
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = ???
}
```
`Dc(A - B) = Dc(A) - Dc(B)`: the derivative of difference of A and B is the difference of the derivatives of A and B

`δ(A - B) = δ(A) and ~δ(B)`: nullable if A is nullable and B is not nullable
---

# Code: Difference

```scala
case class Difference(x: Regex, y: Regex) extends Regex {
  lazy val nullable = x.nullable && !y.nullable
  def derive(c: Char): Regex = Difference(x.derive(c), y.derive(c))
}
```
`Dc(A - B) = Dc(A) - Dc(B)`: the derivative of difference of A and B is the difference of the derivatives of A and B

`δ(A - B) = δ(A) and ~δ(B)`: nullable if A is nullable and B is not nullable
---

# Alright, let's try it!

```scala
scala> val single = Single('s')
single: Single = Single(s)

scala> single.matches("s")
res0: Boolean = true

scala> single.matches("x")
res1: Boolean = false
```
---

# Alright, let's try it!

```scala
scala> val seq = Sequence(Single('s'), Single('c'))
seq: Sequence = Sequence(Single(s),Single(c))

scala> seq.matches("sc")
res2: Boolean = true
```
---

# Alright, let's try it!

```scala
scala> val comp = Complement(single)
comp: Complement = Complement(Single(s))

scala> comp.matches("s")
res3: Boolean = false

scala> comp.matches("b")
res4: Boolean = true

scala> Complement(comp).matches("b")
res5: Boolean = false
```

---

# Alright, let's try it!

```scala
scala> Difference(Single('s'), Single('s')).matches("s")
res6: Boolean = false

scala> Difference(Single('s'), Single('s')).matches("s")
res7: Boolean = false
```
